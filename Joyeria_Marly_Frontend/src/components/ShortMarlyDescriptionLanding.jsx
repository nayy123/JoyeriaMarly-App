        For over 3 years, Marly Handmade has been creating unique jewelry pieces
        from our Lima studio.

      <p>
        We carefully craft each bracelet, earring, necklace, and ring using
        materials such as <i>polymer clay, copper wire, resin, and textile</i>.

        <strong>
          Every design is inspired by the vibrant colors of our local landscape,
          the richness of our culture, and the joy of self-expression.
